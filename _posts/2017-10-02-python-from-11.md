[Learn Python 3 the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/)の「Exercise 11 - 」で学んだことのまとめです。

## Exercise 11: Asking Questions 

```python
# input()の中にterminalで入力した文字列や数を代入する

# How old are you? 
# →terminalで"31"を入力
print("How old are you?", end=' ')
age = input()

# How tall are you? 
# →terminalで"165cm"を入力
print("How tall are you?", end=' ')
height = input()

# How much do you weigh? 
# →terminalで"49kg"を入力
print("How much do you weigh?", end=' ')
weight = input()

# So, You're 31 old, 165cm tall, 49kg heavy.
print(f"So, You're {age} old, {height} tall, {weight} heavy.")
```

```python
# input()の中にterminalで入力した文字列や数を代入する

# How old are you? 
print("How old are you?", end=' ')
age = input()
# →terminalで"31"を入力
# →How old are you? 31


# How tall are you? 
print("How tall are you?", end=' ')
height = input()
# →terminalで"165cm"を入力
# →How tall are you? 165cm

# How much do you weigh? 
print("How much do you weigh?", end=' ')
weight = input()
# →terminalで"49kg"を入力
# →How much do you weigh? 49kg

# So, You're 31 old, 165cm tall, 49kg heavy.
print(f"So, You're {age} old, {height} tall, {weight} heavy.")
```

## Exercise 12: Prompting People

```python
# input()の中に直接入力した文字列を表示して、terminalで結果を入力する
# =ex11と同じことを実行できる

# How old are you?
age = input("How old are you? ")
# →terminalで31を入力
# →How old are you? 31

# How tall are you?
height = input("How tall are you? ")
# →terminalで165cmを入力
# →How tall are you? 165cm

# How much do you weigh?
weight = input("How much do you weigh? ")
# →terminalで49kgを入力
# →How much do you weigh? 49kg

# So, you're 31 old, 165cm tall and 49kg heavy.
print(f"So, you're {age} old, {height} tall and {weight} heavy.")

# prompt = ユーザーに入力させること
