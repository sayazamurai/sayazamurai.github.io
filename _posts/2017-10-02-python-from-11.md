[Learn Python 3 the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/)の「Exercise 11 - 」で学んだことのまとめです。

## Exercise 11: 

```python
# input()の中にterminalで入力した文字列や数を代入する

# How old are you? 
# →terminalで"31"を入力
print("How old are you?", end=' ')
age = input()

# How tall are you? 
# →terminalで"165cm"を入力
print("How tall are you?", end=' ')
height = input()

# How much do you weigh? 
# →terminalで"49kg"を入力
print("How much do you weigh?", end=' ')
weight = input()

# So, You're 31 old, 165cm tall, 49kg heavy.
print(f"So, You're {age} old, {height} tall, {weight} heavy.")
```

```python
# How many members are there in Sexy Zone? 5
# Who is the youngest menber? Marius
print("How many members are there in Sexy Zone?", end=' ')
members = input()
print("Who is the youngest menber?", end=' ')
the_youngest = input()

# There are 5 members in Sexy Zone, and Marius is the youngest of all.
print(f"There are {members} members in Sexy Zone, and {the_youngest} is the youngest of all.")
```
